### Article 1
 -  Article name.
 Facial recognition cameras will put us all in an identity parade

-  Reference or article citation.
The Guardian, Frederike Kaltheuner

- Briefly describe the article's premise.
This article covers the deployment of surveillance cameras by the Metropolitan Police throughout the streets of London. These cameras, which are equipped with real-time facial recognition software, are distributed with the intent to a) capture felons or fugitives or b) monitor criminals with serious crimes on their record. Although it seems like an "okay" idea, I believe this type of technology raises a lot of ethical problems.

- What is the ethical concern, in your opinion?
First, Even though the cameras might be effective in some measure to keep the streets of London safe, many are questioning how effective they really are. The cameras perform the best when recognizing white men, but produce errors when attempting to recognize minorities. This could lead to certain groups being misidentified and potentially lead to arrests for crimes that were not committed to this individual. Further, most people are unaware that they are even being facially recognized and subsequently tracked, which certainly feels like a violation of privacy. The cameras are always on, and in order to distinguish criminals, they have to be surveilling everyone.

- What data is being manipulated in the article?
While none of this data is being abused, I believe that there is a huge opportunity for it to be. The facial recognition software can provide information on things like where people are shopping or if they are attending protests - actions that should be relatively personal and anonymous. If someone were to sell this information to corporations, they could illegally created a database of potential consumers based off of real-time actions. Technology also has the tendency to build upon itself. If these cameras remain in use, it could serve as a bridge to even more invasive tech. Even though this feels like something out of a dystopian movie, we are not far away from these type of things becoming a reality.

- Briefly describe the analysis, as you understand it.
From my understanding, the data (images of faces) are being captured by these cameras and then processed by software which can identify, track and reveal other information about said face.

- Who stands to lose or to gain something from this form of analysis?
I think that a lot of people have something to lose from this. First, everyone who is being recognized is losing a piece of their privacy without consent. Second, groups such as immigrants or minorities have a lot to lose, with the software still struggling to correctly identify minority groups. Minority groups face being falsely arrested or deported. The people who have something to gain from this could be police, as it makes their jobs easier, and potentially corporations who could data-mine in way, despite being highly unethical.


### Article 2
 -  Article name.
 Apple apologizes for listening to Siri recordings, promises changes

-  Reference or article citation.
CNN Business, Kaya Yurieff

- Briefly describe the article's premise.
This article covers how Apple has apologized for letting contractors listen to commands that users give to Siri. Apple has now given the user the choice to opt in or out for their voice commands to be reviewed or listened to by human workers, as opposed to this being assumed to be agreed upon.

- What is the ethical concern, in your opinion?
I think the ethical concern here came from people being unaware that their recordings with Siri were being listened to. Further, I think it is unethical that it was strangers from outside the Apple corporation that were listening to these recordings. I think this violates the user's privacy, especially since they were previously not given a choice. I have always been creeped out by Siri, since because it has to be able to hear the voice prompt to activate, it means it always has to be listening.

- What data is being manipulated in the article?
The data that is being manipulated in this article is people's recordings and any information which they include in Siri commands. This could stem from music choices, to directions, to text messages, to even sensitive information like banking information or addresses.

- Briefly describe the analysis, as you understand it.
From my understanding, it seems like Siri commands are being analyzed by people, whose intentions are unclear. Further, Siri is able to connect to your internet browser and provide search options based on what you say.

- Who stands to lose or to gain something from this form of analysis?
Corporations are the ones who stand to gain from this form of analysis. As we talked about, data-mining is very real and provides many companies access to plug their products based on the prior searches and other inferred information, which can all be access through things like Siri commands.
