### Article 1
 -  Article name.
 - Facial recognition cameras will put us all in an identity parade

-  Reference or article citation.
 - Frederike Kaltheuner, The Guardian

- Briefly describe the article's premise.
 - This article covers the deployment of surveillance cameras by the Metropolitan Police throughout the streets of London. These cameras, which are equipped with real-time facial recognition software, are distributed with the intent to a) capture felons or fugitives or b) monitor criminals with serious crimes on their record. Although it seems like an "okay" idea, I believe this type of technology raises a lot of ethical problems.

- What is the ethical concern, in your opinion?
First, Even though the cameras might be effective in some measure to keep the streets of London safe, many are questioning how effective they really are. The cameras perform the best when recognizing white men, but produce errors when attempting to recognize minorities. This could lead to certain groups being misidentified and potentially lead to arrests for crimes that were not committed to this individual. Further, most people are unaware that they are even being facially recognized and subsequently tracked, which certainly feels like a violation of privacy. The cameras are always on, and in order to distinguish criminals, they have to be surveilling everyone.

- What data is being manipulated in the article?
While none of this data is being abused, I believe that there is a huge opportunity for it to be. The facial recognition software can provide information on things like where people are shopping or if they are attending protests - actions that should be relatively personal and anonymous. If someone were to sell this information to corporations, they could illegally created a database of potential consumers based off of real-time actions. Technology also has the tendency to build upon itself. If these cameras remain in use, it could serve as a bridge to even more invasive tech. Even though this feels like something out of a dystopian movie, we are not far away from these type of things becoming a reality.

- Briefly describe the analysis, as you understand it.
From my understanding, the data (images of faces) are being captured by these cameras and then processed by software which can identify, track and reveal other information about said face.

- Who stands to lose or to gain something from this form of analysis?
I think that a lot of people have something to lose from this. First, everyone who is being recognized is losing a piece of their privacy without consent. Second, groups such as immigrants or minorities have a lot to lose, with the software still struggling to correctly identify minority groups. Minority groups face being falsely arrested or deported. The people who have something to gain from this could be police, as it makes their jobs easier, and potentially corporations who could data-mine in way, despite being highly unethical.
